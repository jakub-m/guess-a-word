# Guess-a-word (PL)

[Play here.][ref_play]

A polish version of [Wordle][ref_w] for my kids. No ads or other shitware ever allowed.

The polish words are taken from [SJP][ref_sjp]. The dictionary to check if an inserted word is valid was compressed
using a [Bloom filter][ref_blc].

Emojis listed with [emojihash][ref_emojihash].
